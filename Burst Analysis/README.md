Code for analysis of the temporal dynamics of a periodic signal. A periodic signal can either be relatively continuous or bursty, and this code quantifies the number of bursts and the burst duration within the frequency range of the periodic signal.

For analysis of alpha-like oscillations in mice, the frequency range of interest is 2-10 Hz. 

This code requires MATLAB and the signal processing toolbox in MATLAB. It was developed on version R2018b.

To use this code, r
