Dependencies are .m files that the code calls on. Which .m used depends on the user's response to prompted input in run_burst_analysis.m.

Data are .mat files which are arrays (number of subjects x length of timeseries*sampling frequency).
Datasets from both freely-moving EEG and head-fixed LFP recordings are included and the run_burst_analysis.m will automatically analyze these files unless other files from the list in the code are selected and added to the current folder from FigShare.
