# FXS-alpha
Repository for the code used in "A human electrophysiological biomarker of Fragile X Syndrome is shared in V1 of Fmr1 KO mice and caused by loss of FMRP in cortical excitatory neurons." The code generates an improved 1/f fit of power spectra from human and mouse EEG/LFP data to show conserved disruptions of "alpha" periodic activity across species in FXS.

All code was developed and written by Dr. Sara Kornfeld-Sylla while in the Bear Lab at MIT.

This code calls on functions from the Chronux Toolbox for signal processing. Please download Chronux version 2.12 here: https://chronux.org/
